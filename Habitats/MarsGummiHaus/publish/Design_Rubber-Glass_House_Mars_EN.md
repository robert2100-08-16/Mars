**Proposal: Design of a 1000 m² Rubber-Glass House for Mars**

Dear Sir or Madam,  
Mars represents the next great frontier of human exploration. To successfully advance the settlement of Mars, the development of innovative, sustainable, and safe habitats is crucial. We present to you a unique concept: a 1000 m² rubber-glass house, specifically designed for the extreme conditions of Mars. This project offers an exceptional investment opportunity in the future of space travel and extraterrestrial colonization.

### 1. Concept and Design

**Floor Plan and Structure**
- **Total Area:** 1000 m² (50 m x 20 m)
- **Height:** 3 m, sufficient for living and working spaces

**Materials**
- **Rubber floor slab and foundation wall:** Cast from silicone rubber on-site
- **Frame:** High-strength titanium or Inconel structure
- **Glazing:** Borosilicate glass with an insulation layer
- **Roof:** Solar panels for energy generation
- **Airlock:** Titanium/Inconel construction with borosilicate glass

### 2. Detailed Description

**Rubber Floor Slab and Foundation Wall**
- **Material:** Silicone rubber to ensure flexibility and airtightness
- **Dimensions:**
  - Floor slab: 1000 m², thickness 10 cm
  - Foundation wall: 140 m circumference, 50 cm height, 10 cm thickness
- **Volume:** 107 m³ of silicone rubber

**Titanium or Inconel Frame**
- **Weight:** 5500 kg including fastenings (rivets or screws)
- **Advantages:** Excellent corrosion resistance, high strength, and thermal stability

**Borosilicate Glass with Insulation Layer**
- **Area:** 1000 m²
