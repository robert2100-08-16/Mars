## Executive Summary

Future Mars exploration demands more than durable rovers — it requires adaptive, resilient explorers capable of reaching terrains untouched by wheels. "Mars Field Laboratories" proposes an integrated strategy of autonomous legged robots and cooperative robotic clusters. This dual approach blends flexibility and robustness, enabling broad-area surveying, precision science, and mutual support. By embedding social behaviors into robot systems, we unleash a fascinating vision: a self-sustaining robotic ecosystem, resilient against Mars' formidable challenges. Our mission design enhances scientific yield, operational resilience, and paves the path toward human expansion.

## 1. Introduction

Building on decades of successful rover missions—such as Sojourner, Spirit, and Mars 2020's Perseverance—and terrestrial tests of legged robot prototypes (e.g., SpaceClimber and ANYmal), we recognize the necessity for more adaptable explorers. Flexible, autonomous, and resilient robotic systems are crucial for accessing complex terrains and performing in-depth analyses that wheeled platforms cannot achieve. This paper presents two complementary mission concepts—Type A and Type B—to significantly advance the search for life and environmental characterization on Mars.
