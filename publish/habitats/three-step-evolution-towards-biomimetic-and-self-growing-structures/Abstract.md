## Abstract

This paper presents a three‑step conceptual evolution of Martian habitat construction, progressing from traditional engineering principles to biomimetic lightweight materials and ultimately to autonomous, self‑growing silicon‑based structures. Building upon the foundational Mars Rubber‑Glass House Project, this work outlines a scalable, sustainable pathway for future Mars habitats. Each phase is grounded in current or emerging material science: from titanium‑silicone‑glass hybrid domes to silica‑aerogel frameworks with biological reinforcement patterns, culminating in synthetic structures capable of growth, self‑repair and adaptation using Martian resources. The paper discusses technical principles, material candidates, environmental integration and the long‑term vision of autonomous life‑supporting architecture for space colonisation.
