### 1. Two-Story Rubber-Glass House

#### Floor Plan and Structure
- **Total Area:** 1000 m² (50 m x 20 m) per level, 2000 m² total
- **Height:** 6 m (3 m per level)
- **Roof:** Flat roof

#### Materials
- **Rubber floor slab and foundation wall:** Cast from silicone rubber on site
- **Frame:** High-strength titanium or Inconel structure
- **Glazing:** Borosilicate glass with insulation layer
- **Roof:** Solar panels for energy generation
- **Airlock:** Titanium/Inconel construction with borosilicate glass

#### Quantity Calculation
- **Rubber floor slab and foundation wall:** Double the amount of silicone rubber (214 m³)
- **Frame:** Increased demand for titanium/Inconel (approx. 11,000 kg)
- **Borosilicate glass:** 2000 m²
- **Solar panels:** 1000 m²
- **Airlock:** 2 units

### 2. Three-Story Rubber-Glass House with Basement

#### Floor Plan and Structure
- **Total Area:** 1000 m² (50 m x 20 m) per level, 3000 m² total
- **Height:** 9 m (3 m per level) plus basement
- **Basement:** Fully rubber-coated, same area as ground floor

#### Materials
- **Rubber floor slab and foundation wall:** Cast from silicone rubber on site
- **Frame:** High-strength titanium or Inconel structure
- **Glazing:** Borosilicate glass with insulation layer
- **Roof:** Solar panels for energy generation
- **Airlock:** Titanium/Inconel construction with borosilicate glass

#### Quantity Calculation
- **Rubber floor slab and foundation wall:** Four times the amount of silicone rubber (428 m³)
- **Frame:** Increased demand for titanium/Inconel (approx. 16,500 kg)
- **Borosilicate glass:** 3000 m²
- **Solar panels:** 1000 m²
- **Airlock:** 3 units

### 3. Two-Story Rubber-Glass House with Pitched Roof

#### Floor Plan and Structure
- **Total Area:** 1000 m² (50 m x 20 m) per level, 2000 m² total
- **Height:** 6 m (3 m per level) plus pitched roof
- **Roof:** Pitched roof

#### Materials
- **Rubber floor slab and foundation wall:** Cast from silicone rubber on site
- **Frame:** High-strength titanium or Inconel structure
- **Glazing:** Borosilicate glass with insulation layer
- **Roof:** Solar panels for energy generation, adapted to pitched roof
- **Airlock:** Titanium/Inconel construction with borosilicate glass

#### Quantity Calculation
- **Rubber floor slab and foundation wall:** Double the amount of silicone rubber (214 m³)
- **Frame:** Increased demand for titanium/Inconel (approx. 11,000 kg)
- **Borosilicate glass:** 2000 m²
- **Solar panels:** 1000 m², adjusted to the roof angle
- **Airlock:** 2 units

### Conclusion

Each variant offers specific advantages and challenges in terms of construction, materials, and energy efficiency. The decision for one variant should be based on specific requirements, the availability of resources, and long-term plans for Martian colonization.

These variants take advantage of locally available materials and sustainable building methods to minimize costs and dependence on supplies from Earth.
